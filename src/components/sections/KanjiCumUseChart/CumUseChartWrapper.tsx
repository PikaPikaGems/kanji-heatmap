            This graph shows the cumulative usage percentage of different
            character sets across various sources (e.g., novels, Netflix
            subtitles, online news, Twitter, Wikipedia, etc.) as a function of
            frequency rank (Standard competition ranking). The graph highlights
            how quickly the most frequent items build up to account for the bulk
            of the overall usage.

            This shows that higher ranked characters are more frequently
            used.The cumulative usage percentage rises steeply at first, meaning
            a relatively small number of high-frequency characters contribute
            significantly to the overall text coverage. As the frequency rank
            increases, the growth rate slows down.
