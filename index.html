            Kanji Heatmap is an exploration tool with advanced filtering,
            sorting, frequency heatmap visualizations, and detailed kanji
            information. This tool can help you prioritize which kanji to learn
            based on your specific goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            The kanji you encounter in casual Twitter posts differ from those
            found in literary works, and the kanji commonly used in TV dramas
            may vary from those in news articles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Visual learners will appreciate the heatmap feature, which
            highlights more frequently used kanji in brighter colors, with less
            common characters shown in progressively duller shades.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike many kanji resources that display characters in a single
            style, Kanji Heatmap lets you change fonts to see how the appearance
            of characters can vary.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Kanji Heatmap is not a dictionary, it offers useful kanji
            details. Simply click on any kanji to view sample words, meanings,
            onyomi and kunyomi readings, stroke order animations, component
            breakdowns, and more.

              Customizable Study Focus – Users can sort and filter kanji by JLPT
              level, school grade (Japanese education system), frequency rank

            <li>
              Interactive Exploration – Hovering or clicking on a kanji provides

            <li>
              Study Planning – Helps users identify gaps in their knowledge by
              highlighting which high-frequency kanji they haven't learned yet.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Useful for</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Efficiency – Prioritizes learning the kanji you’ll encounter most
              often.
            </li>

              importance at a glance.

            <li>
              Test Preparation – Great for JLPT or kanji kentei study by
              focusing on level-appropriate characters.
            </li>
            <li>
              Review & Gap Analysis – Advanced learners can check if they’ve
              missed any common kanji.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Kanji Heatmap is particularly useful if you want a data-driven
            approach to kanji learning rather than just following a fixed order
            (like RTK or JLPT lists)
